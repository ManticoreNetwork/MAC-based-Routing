# MAC-based-Routing
We suffered a breach where a Guest (lively a phone app) was compromised or hacked, Thereby giving away our Fiber IP! To Prevent this: Have all known &amp; secure Client MACs routed out one IP, and have Guest MACs routed out a completely different &amp; Dynamic IP! So if they are hacked they can't expose information about our primary network.
